# Exploratory Coverage Analysis

## Purpose

To provide a running documentation of exploratory efforts by QAnalysts-Kirkland.

### Example Testing Effort:
1) 'git pull' // establish working directory of previous day's efforts

2) Determine an app to invest exploratory time into.

3) Begin daily write-up on testing-pad: tester, time-began, environment variables, expected testing (+ gaia git commits for halo testing), etc.

4) Begin running effort of application execution and results:

    * What are you testing?

    * How is the app responding?

    * Is there any issues?

    * Have these issues been previously bugged?

    * Log bug #'s (previously bugged or newly written) inline.

    * Sum up total issues (old and new) observed and written)


5) 'git commit -m [include comment here' // commit your observations for the day with a message including a brief summary of your efforts.

6) 'git push [branch] upstream' // push your commit to the repository. May want to work a separate branch to preserve the integrity of your master branch.


-- Or --

If you were testing via a matrice, save the table in a Libre Office table and commit+push through the proper directory.
